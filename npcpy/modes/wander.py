    Wander mode is an exploratory mode where an LLM is given a task and they begin to wander through space.
    As they wander, they drift in between conscious thought and popcorn-like subconscious thought
    The former is triggered by external stimuli andw when these stimuli come we will capture the recent high entropy
    infromation from the subconscious popcorn thoughts and then consider them with respect to the initial problem at hand.

    The conscious evaluator will attempt to connect them, thus functionalizing the verse-jumping algorithm
    outlined by Everything Everywhere All at Once.
