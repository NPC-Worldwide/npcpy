Welcome to `npcpy`, the python library for the NPC Toolkit and the home of the core command-line programs that make up the NPC Shell (`npcsh`). 


`npcpy` is an agent-based framework designed to easily integrate AI models into one's daily workflow and it does this by providing users with a variety of interfaces through which they can use, test, and explore the capabilities of AI models, agents, and agent systems.
